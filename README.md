# Bike Demand Prediction — Streamlit App

A focused project that predicts bike rentals/demand using machine learning and exposes an interactive Streamlit interface for exploration, training, evaluation, and single-row predictions.

This repository contains:
- A Streamlit web app to explore data, train models, and run live predictions.
- Data preprocessing and feature-engineering pipelines.
- Example models (baseline and tuned) and evaluation code.
- Optional saved model artifacts for quick inference.

Project goals:
- Provide an easy-to-run demonstration of end-to-end ML for time-series / tabular bike-demand prediction.
- Make model behavior understandable through metrics and explainability (feature importance, partial dependence).
- Provide a small, deployable Streamlit app suitable for local use or cloud hosting.

---

## Key features
- Upload or use example bike rental datasets (e.g., UCI / Capital Bikeshare style)  
- Interactive EDA: time-series plots, hourly/daily/seasonal aggregations, correlation matrices  
- Preprocessing pipeline: handling datetimes, categorical encoding, scaling, engineered features (hour, weekday, weather bins, holidays)  
- Train and compare regression models: Linear Regression, RandomForest, Gradient Boosting (examples)  
- Performance metrics: MAE, RMSE, R² and residual plots  
- Single-record prediction UI: enter feature values and get predicted bike demand  
- Model explainability: feature importance and optional SHAP summaries

---

## Dataset
This project expects a tabular dataset with rows representing time periods (hour/day) and columns such as:
- datetime or timestamp
- season, holiday, workingday (optional)
- weather indicators (e.g., temp, humidity, windspeed)
- count / demand (target column)

Example public dataset: "Bike Sharing Dataset" (UCI) — but any CSV with a similar schema works. If your dataset schema differs, update the preprocessing code or mapping in the app.

Recommended CSV columns:
- datetime (or date, hour)
- temp, atemp (or a single temperature column)
- humidity
- windspeed
- weather (categorical)
- season (categorical)
- holiday, workingday (binary)
- count (target)

## Repository layout (example)
- app.py or streamlit_app.py — Streamlit entrypoint (UI + controller)
- src/
  - data.py — loaders and dataset helpers
  - preprocess.py — feature engineering & pipeline code
  - models.py — model training, evaluation helpers
  - predict.py — inference helpers
- notebooks/ — optional EDA and experiments
- data/ — sample datasets (not included if large)
- models/ — saved model artifacts (joblib/pickle)
- requirements.txt

Adjust these paths to match the concrete files in this repo.

## Quick start — run locally

1. Clone the repo
   - git clone https://github.com/RohitKumarJain16/Machine-Learning-with-Streamlit.git
   - cd Machine-Learning-with-Streamlit

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
   - python -m venv .venv
   - source .venv/bin/activate   (macOS / Linux)
   - .venv\Scripts\activate      (Windows PowerShell)

3. Install dependencies
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - If no requirements.txt, install minimal set:
     - pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib shap

4. Run the Streamlit app
   - streamlit run app.py
   - Or if the repo uses a different name:
     - streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   - Open http://localhost:8501 (Streamlit will usually open it automatically)

---

## Typical workflow
1. Start the app and explore the sample dataset or upload your CSV.
2. Use the EDA panels to understand seasonality and feature distributions.
3. Configure preprocessing and select models to train/compare.
4. Inspect evaluation metrics and residuals.
5. Save the best model (joblib/pickle) and use the single-record prediction panel for live inference.

## Example: programmatic prediction (optional)
If this repo exposes a prediction function or Flask/fastapi endpoint, you can call it like:

- Using saved model and a predict script:
  python src/predict.py --model models/best_model.joblib --input sample.json

- Example JSON format (single sample):
  {
    "datetime":"2021-06-21 08:00:00",
    "season":3,
    "holiday":0,
    "workingday":1,
    "weather":1,
    "temp":25.3,
    "humidity":40,
    "windspeed":3.2
  }

Adjust keys to match preprocessing expectations.

---

## Models & evaluation
- Baseline models: mean predictor, linear regression  
- Tree-based models: RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor / XGBoost or LightGBM (optional)  
- Evaluation: MAE, RMSE, R², residual plots, time-series error analysis (by hour/day/season)

Tip: Use cross-validation with time-aware splits (TimeSeriesSplit) if the dataset has temporal ordering.

---

## Explainability
- Feature importance (model.feature_importances_ for tree models)
- Partial dependence plots for key features
- Optional SHAP summaries to explain individual predictions and global effects

---

## Deployment
- Streamlit Cloud: connect repository and set the app entrypoint (app.py or streamlit_app.py)  
- Docker (example):
  FROM python:3.10-slim
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . /app
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
  EXPOSE 8501
  CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]

- For production APIs, export the trained model and serve via FastAPI / Flask behind a web server.

---

## Development tips
- Keep pipeline code (preprocess.py) separate from UI code. This makes unit testing easier.
- Use @st.cache_data and @st.cache_resource for expensive loads and model artifacts in Streamlit.
- Version trained models and record training parameters (hyperparameters, training data snapshot, metrics).
- Use small sample datasets for UI responsiveness; provide links to full datasets for offline training.

---

## Tests
If you add tests, include simple unit tests for:
- Feature engineering functions
- Model training pipeline (smoke tests)
- Prediction function outputs for known inputs

---

## Contributing
Contributions welcome. Suggested workflow:
- Fork → branch (feat/...) → implement → tests → PR with a clear description and screenshots for UI changes.

Please follow repository guidelines, code style (PEP8), and include tests where appropriate.

If you want, I can:
- Update this README in the repository (create a branch and a commit), or
- Tailor the README to the exact filenames and app entrypoint if you tell me the exact app filename (for example, app.py or apps/bike_app.py). Which would you like me to do next?
